# Week-1
This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning by analyzing pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2) and meteorological data. It involves data preprocessing, model training , and evaluation. Accurate predictions can aid in pollution control and public health awareness.
